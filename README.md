# NYC-Taxi-Data-Engineering-Project â€“ Microsoft Fabric

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric to process, transform, and analyze New York City taxi trip data. It showcases key components such as the Lakehouse architecture and automated orchestration using Data Factory.

---

## Project Goals

- Ingest and process NYC taxi trip data from ADLS Gen2
- Implement Medallion architecture: Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
- Automate data pipelines using Fabric Data Factory
- Trigger data processing on file arrival with Data Activator

---

This project is a comprehensive solution for creating an end-to-end pipeline for data processing, transformation and visualization using Microsoft Fabric, including Lakehouse, Data Factory, Dataflows Gen2, SQL Stored Procedures.
