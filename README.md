# NYC-Taxi-Data-Engineering-Project â€“ Microsoft Fabric

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline using **Microsoft Fabric** for processing, transforming, and analyzing New York City
**Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)** trip data. It covers all core components from Lakehouse setup to Power BI reporting and automated orchestration.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Ingest and process NYC taxi trip data from ADLS Gen2
- Implement Medallion architecture: Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
- Automate data pipelines using Fabric Data Factory
- Trigger data processing on file arrival with Data Activator
- Visualize KPIs using Power BI dashboard

---


This project is a comprehensive solution for creating an end-to-end pipeline for data processing, transformation and visualization using Microsoft Fabric, including Lakehouse, Data Factory, Dataflows Gen2, SQL Stored Procedures and Power BI. 

Thanks to [Mr.Malvik Vaghadia](udemy.com/course/microsoft-fabric-the-ultimate-guide) for the project inspiration.

The project demonstrates the construction of a dynamic process for loading and preparing data with automatic parameterization and updating, including working with metadata and building a final report in Power BI.

## Technology Stack
- Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouse, Data Factory, Notebooks)
- Azure ADLS Gen2
- Power BI
- Data Activator
- SQL & Python
