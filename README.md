# NYC-Taxi-Data-Engineering-Project â€“ Microsoft Fabric

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric to process, transform, and analyze New York City taxi trip data. It showcases key components such as the Lakehouse architecture and automated orchestration using Data Factory.

---

## Project Goals

- Ingest and process NYC taxi trip data from ADLS Gen2
- Implement Medallion architecture: Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
- Automate data pipelines using Fabric Data Factory
- Trigger data processing on file arrival with Data Activator

---

This project is a comprehensive solution for creating an end-to-end pipeline for data processing, transformation and visualization using Microsoft Fabric, including Lakehouse, Data Factory, Dataflows Gen2, SQL Stored Procedures.

# Project Implementation Stages 

## Setting Up the Development Environment

##  Set Up ADLS Gen2 & Lakehouse

- Set Up ADLS Gen2 & Lakehouse
- Created an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
- Added landing-zone container.
- Built a Lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric named NYC_Project_Lekahouse.
- Inside the Lakehouse, created three schemas: Bronze, Silver, and Gold for each data processing layer.
- Created a shortcut in Fabric Lakehouse to the landing-zone container.
